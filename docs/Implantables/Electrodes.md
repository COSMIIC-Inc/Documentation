## Component Overview

Summarized Text

## Technical Description of Electrode Types

The electrode cable is fabricated using wires of 316LVM stainless steel (0.034 mm diameter 
each), organized into a single seven-filament strand and coated with a perfluoroalkoxy 
polymer (PFA) to form an insulated, conducting filar. The cable is fabricated by winding 
two filars in tandem, forming a double helix of two conductors electrically insulated along 
their length. The coiled filars are placed inside medical-grade silicone tubing to form the 
cable. The cable outer diameter is approximately 1.3 mm. Since both electrode types used 
are monopolar - one tissue contact - the two filars are shorted to each other at the electrode 
and connector end, creating a single conductor with half the electrical resistance.

Patient-contacting materials
- Silicone elastomer insulation
- Liquid silicone rubber and pigment strain relief with dual O-ring
- Silicone adhesive and low-consistency silicone elastomer for adhesive

### Intramuscular Stimulating Electrodes

The intramuscular recording electrodes used in this study are identical to those used in our 
other IDE’s, G890084, G900108, G950116, and G040214. Electrical stimulation is delivered 
through metal electrodes placed near or in direct contact with neural tissue. Each electrode 
consists of the contact itself, a conducting lead, and a dual-contact connector to mate to the 
PG4 module. The intramuscular stimulating electrode is designed to be inserted into the 
belly of the target muscle. Despite the location of the electrode inside the muscle, electrical 
pulses delivered through the electrode cause activation of the nerves branching into the 
muscle, rather than direct activation of the muscle tissue itself.

The intramuscular stimulating electrode consists of 316LVM stainless steel wire coiled 
around the outside of the lead tubing [Memberg et al., 1994]. The stimulating surface is 
2mm long with an approximate surface area of 8 mm2. A 2-mm long polypropylene barbed 
anchor on the tip of the electrode maintains the position of the electrode in soft tissue. The 
electrode is inserted into the muscle using a probe and cannula system. The electrode is 
deployed into the muscle with a hemi-section of 15-gauge 304SS tubing inserted through a 
sheath of 13XTW-gauge 304SS tubing.
The lead cable is identical to the cable utilized for the epimysial stimulating electrode, 
described below. A dual-contact connector is used for all connections in the NNP System, as 
previously described.

Patient-contacting materials
- 316LVM stainless steel electrical contact
- Monofilament polypropylene anchoring barb
- Silicone adhesive over-molding

### Epimysial Stimulating Electrodes

The epimysial electrodes used in this study are identical to those used in our other IDE’s, 
G890084, G900108, G950116, and G040214. Electrical stimulation is delivered through 
metal electrodes placed near or in direct contact with neural tissue. Each electrode consists 
of the contact itself, a conducting lead, and a connection to the PG4 module. The epimysial 
stimulating electrode is designed to be sewn onto the surface of the target muscle. Despite 
the location of the electrode on the muscle, electrical pulses delivered through the electrode 
cause activation of the nerves branching into the muscle, rather than direct activation of the 
muscle tissue itself. Epimysial stimulation electrodes have been utilized for nearly 25 years 
and have an excellent durability and safety record.

The epimysial stimulating electrode is a platinum-iridium disk with a brim supported by 
polyester mesh reinforced silicone rubber. The exposed metal contact is a disc 3.3 mm in 
diameter with a surface area of 8.55 mm2. The brim is sandwiched between two layers of silicone elastomer, leaving the conducting surface exposed through a hole in the top layer. 

The platinum apron serves to hold the disc in place. The lead wire is welded to the back of 
the disk using a resistance welder in an inert gas environment. The silicone backing is 
reinforced with polyester mesh. The electrode is sewn onto the muscle epimysium using 
sutures through the polyester mesh backing. Five sutures are placed around the perimeter 
of the electrode backing, each tied with four knots, using 4-0 polyester suture. 
The lead cable consists of seven Type-316LVM stainless steel wires (0.034 mm diameter 
each), organized into a single seven-filament strand and insulated with PFA. The lead is 
fabricated by winding two lengths of cable in tandem, forming a double helix of two 
conductors electrically insulated along their length but shorted to each other at the 
electrode and connector end. The coiled lead is placed inside medical-grade Silicone tubing. 
The lead outer diameter is approximately 1.3 mm.

The dual-contact connector is used for all connections in the NNP System and is described 
in more detail in the section on Network Cables (above).

Patient-contacting materials
- Platinum 10% Iridium electrode surface
- Polyester-reinforced silicone sheeting electrode backing and suture skirt
- Low-consistency silicone elastomer over-molding
